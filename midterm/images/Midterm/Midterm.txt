Midterm:

Your goal is to recreate this website: 

https://myhra-fluid-demo.squarespace.com/?_gl=1*eomb6t*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQiAkJO8BhCGARIsAMkswygaZA5d4DQAbNw-naoRIrK3N2y91TKnBeklF4yRkKMfxJwILhUGrOYaAruYEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds


This website will only have the 
- home page (index.html)
- style sheet (styles.css)
- js file (script.js)

The menu items, the login and work with me button are not part of the exam.
In place of the Work With Me button, create a dark mode - light mode switch button.

The images are provided. Good luck!
